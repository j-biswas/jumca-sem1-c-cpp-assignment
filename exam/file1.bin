No, for only assignment operations, the constructor is not called.

When you assign an already constructed object to another object of the same type, it's the assignment operator that is invoked, not the constructor.

However, if the assignment involves a different type, a conversion constructor (if available) might be called to convert the assigned object to the type of the variable receiving the assignment.

But if both the object being assigned and the variable receiving the assignment are of the same type, only the assignment operator is called.
